    <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <i>fundamental</i> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
    <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for <b>H</b>yperText <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p><br>
    HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    <br>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
	<br>
	<ol>
	<li>The opening tag</li>
	<li>The closing tag</li>
	<li>The actual element</li>
	</ol>
